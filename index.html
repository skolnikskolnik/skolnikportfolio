            class="img-fluid" alt="Julie Altman"> Hi! My name is Julie Skolnik Altman, and welcome to my portfolio page!
          I'll tell you a little about me, my background, my interests, and how that influences my work. </p>
        <p>I grew up in Cherry Hill, NJ and I went to Rutgers University, where I studied chemistry. After finishing my
          undergrad, I went to the University of Chicago, where I completed an MS in Chemistry. In graduate school, I
          taught organic chemistry and focused my own studies on Physical and Theoretical chemistry, which is where I
          had my first experiences with computer programming.</p>
        <p>After finishing my BA and MS, I decided to become a chemistry teacher, and I have been teaching at the high
          school level for over seven years. In addition to teaching chemistry, I was also the coach of the Robotics
          team for two years. As the coach of the Robotics team, I had to learn how to work with Arduino hardware and
          software in order to teach my students how to make the devices they wanted to make. I thought this was going
          to be 20% teaching and 80% supervising, and to an extent that was true, but I was shocked at how much of my
          teaching was debugging my students' programs.</p>
        <p>I was approached to bring AP Computer Science Principles to my school, despite having no formal background in
          computer science. I worked with code.org, both online and via in-person trainings, and I really love teaching
          AP CS Principles. The AP CSP course is geared towards young students, mostly freshmen, who have little to no
          background in computer science. I love how the curriculum is accessible and rigorous at the same time, and the
          lesson plans build conceptual understanding of key concepts. This isn't an ad for <a
            href="https:code.org">code.org</a>! This is really how I feel about the curriculum.</p>
